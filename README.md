# EPL-2017-18-Soccer-Analysis
R-coded analysis of the English Premier League (2017/18 season) with RStudio

This is a little class project I did using R to do an analysis on a topic of my choosing. I chose to analyse soccer data to try to answer the following question: is it better/worse to build a professional soccer team with players from a variety of countries or the same country?
